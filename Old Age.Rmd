## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r import, echo=TRUE}
# Read web page
webpage <- read_html("http://www.grg.org/Adams/C_files/sheet001.htm")
webpage
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r include=FALSE}
webpage_table <- html_table(html_nodes(webpage, "table")[[1]], fill = TRUE)
#Cleaning 
table_cleaned_columns <- webpage_table[-c(1:8, 74:118), ]
table_cleaned_rows <- table_cleaned_columns[-c(1,18:22)]

rownames(table_cleaned_rows) <- 1:nrow(table_cleaned_rows)
colnames(table_cleaned_rows) <- c("Birthplace","Name", "Born", "Died", "AgeYears", "AgeDays", "Race", "Sex", "Deathplace", "WhenOldestYearsRange", "WhenOldestAgeRange", "LengthofReignYears", "LengthofReignDays", "ReignLengthInYears", "AgeAtAccessionYears", "AgeAtAccessionDays")

#Export as CSV ----
